### Closest leaf to a given node in Binary Tree :

Given a Binary Tree and a node x in it, find distance of the closest leaf to x in Binary Tree. If given node itself is a leaf, then distance is 0.

I strongly recommend you to minimize your browser and try this yourself first.
The idea is to first traverse the subtree rooted with give node and find the closest leaf in this subtree. Store this distance. Now traverse tree starting from root. If given node x is in left subtree of root, then find the closest leaf in right subtree, else find the closest left in left subtree. Below is the implementation of this idea.

class Node  
{ 
    int key; 
    Node left, right; 
   
    public Node(int key)  
    { 
        this.key = key; 
        left = right = null; 
    } 
} 
   
class Distance  
{ 
    int minDis = Integer.MAX_VALUE; 
} 
   
class BinaryTree  
{ 
    Node root; 
   
    // This function finds closest leaf to root.  This distance 
    // is stored at *minDist. 
    void findLeafDown(Node root, int lev, Distance minDist)  
    { 
           
        // base case 
        if (root == null)  
            return; 
   
        // If this is a leaf node, then check if it is closer 
        // than the closest so far 
        if (root.left == null && root.right == null)  
        { 
            if (lev < (minDist.minDis))  
                minDist.minDis = lev; 
               
            return; 
        } 
   
        // Recur for left and right subtrees 
        findLeafDown(root.left, lev + 1, minDist); 
        findLeafDown(root.right, lev + 1, minDist); 
    } 
   
    // This function finds if there is closer leaf to x through  
    // parent node. 
    int findThroughParent(Node root, Node x, Distance minDist)  
    { 
        // Base cases 
        if (root == null)  
            return -1; 
           
        if (root == x)  
            return 0; 
           
        // Search x in left subtree of root 
        int l = findThroughParent(root.left, x, minDist); 
   
        // If left subtree has x 
        if (l != -1)  
        {     
            // Find closest leaf in right subtree 
            findLeafDown(root.right, l + 2, minDist); 
            return l + 1; 
        } 
   
        // Search x in right subtree of root 
        int r = findThroughParent(root.right, x, minDist); 
   
        // If right subtree has x 
        if (r != -1)  
        { 
            // Find closest leaf in left subtree 
            findLeafDown(root.left, r + 2, minDist); 
            return r + 1; 
        } 
   
        return -1; 
    } 
   
    // Returns minimum distance of a leaf from given node x 
    int minimumDistance(Node root, Node x)  
    { 
        // Initialize result (minimum distance from a leaf) 
        Distance d = new Distance(); 
   
        // Find closest leaf down to x 
        findLeafDown(x, 0, d); 
   
        // See if there is a closer leaf through parent 
        findThroughParent(root, x, d); 
   
        return d.minDis; 
    } 
   
    // Driver program 
    public static void main(String[] args)  
    { 
        BinaryTree tree = new BinaryTree(); 
           
        // Let us create Binary Tree shown in above example 
        tree.root = new Node(1); 
        tree.root.left = new Node(12);

        tree.root.right.right.left = new Node(23); 
        tree.root.right.right.right = new Node(24); 
   
        tree.root.right.left.left.left = new Node(1);

        Node x = tree.root.right; 
   
        System.out.println("The closest leaf to node with value "
                + x.key + " is at a distance of "

### Bubble sort :

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

Example:
First Pass:
( 5 1 4 2 8 ) –> ( 1 5 4 2 8 ), Here, algorithm compares the first two elements, and swaps since 5 > 1.
( 1 5 4 2 8 ) –>  ( 1 4 5 2 8 ), Swap since 5 > 4
( 1 4 5 2 8 ) –>  ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Swap since 5 > 2
( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Now, since these elements are already in order (8 > 5), algorithm does not swap them.

Second Pass:
( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 )
( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ), Swap since 4 > 2
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –>  ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
Now, the array is already sorted, but our algorithm does not know if it is completed. The algorithm needs one whole pass without any swap to know it is sorted.

Third Pass:
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )


// Java program for implementation of Bubble Sort 
class BubbleSort 
{ 
	void bubbleSort(int arr[]) 
	{ 
		int n = arr.length; 
		for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) 
			for (int j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++) 
				if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]) 
				{ 
					// swap arr[j+1] and arr[i] 
					int temp = arr[j]; 
					arr[j] = arr[j+1]; 
					arr[j+1] = temp; 
				} 
	} 

	/* Prints the array */
	void printArray(int arr[]) 
	{ 
		int n = arr.length; 
		for (int i=0; i<n; ++i) 
			System.out.print(arr[i] + " "); 
		System.out.println(); 
	} 

	// Driver method to test above 
	public static void main(String args[]) 
	{ 
		BubbleSort ob = new BubbleSort(); 
		int arr[] = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90}; 
		ob.bubbleSort(arr); 
		System.out.println("Sorted array"); 
		ob.printArray(arr); 
	} 
} 

Output: 
`Sorted array:
11 12 22 25 34 64 90`

### Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm :

iven a graph and a source vertex in the graph, find shortest paths from source to all vertices in the given graph.

Dijkstra’s algorithm is very similar to Prim’s algorithm for minimum spanning tree. Like Prim’s MST, we generate a SPT (shortest path tree) with given source as root. We maintain two sets, one set contains vertices included in shortest path tree, other set includes vertices not yet included in shortest path tree. At every step of the algorithm, we find a vertex which is in the other set (set of not yet included) and has a minimum distance from the source.

Below are the detailed steps used in Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path from a single source vertex to all other vertices in the given graph.
Algorithm
1) Create a set sptSet (shortest path tree set) that keeps track of vertices included in shortest path tree, i.e., whose minimum distance from source is calculated and finalized. Initially, this set is empty.
2) Assign a distance value to all vertices in the input graph. Initialize all distance values as INFINITE. Assign distance value as 0 for the source vertex so that it is picked first.
3) While sptSet doesn’t include all vertices
….a) Pick a vertex u which is not there in sptSet and has minimum distance value.
….b) Include u to sptSet.
….c) Update distance value of all adjacent vertices of u. To update the distance values, iterate through all adjacent vertices. For every adjacent vertex v, if sum of distance value of u (from source) and weight of edge u-v, is less than the distance value of v, then update the distance value of v.

### QuickSort :

Like Merge Sort, QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways.

    Always pick first element as pivot.
    Always pick last element as pivot (implemented below)
    Pick a random element as pivot.
    Pick median as pivot.

The key process in quickSort is partition(). Target of partitions is, given an array and an element x of array as pivot, put x at its correct position in sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller than x) before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x) after x. All this should be done in linear time.

Pseudo Code for recursive QuickSort function :


/* low  --> Starting index,  high  --> Ending index */
quickSort(arr[], low, high)
{
    if (low < high)
    {
        /* pi is partitioning index, arr[pi] is now
           at right place */
        pi = partition(arr, low, high);

        quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1);  // Before pi
        quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high); // After pi
    }
}

Partition Algorithm
`/* low  --> Starting index,  high  --> Ending index */
quickSort(arr[], low, high)
{
    if (low < high)
    {
        /* pi is partitioning index, arr[pi] is now
           at right place */
        pi = partition(arr, low, high);

        quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1);  // Before pi
        quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high); // After pi
    }
}
`

Pseudo code for partition()

`/* This function takes last element as pivot, places
   the pivot element at its correct position in sorted
    array, and places all smaller (smaller than pivot)
   to left of pivot and all greater elements to right
   of pivot */
partition (arr[], low, high)
{
    // pivot (Element to be placed at right position)
    pivot = arr[high];  
 
    i = (low - 1)  // Index of smaller element

    for (j = low; j <= high- 1; j++)
    {
        // If current element is smaller than or
        // equal to pivot
        if (arr[j] <= pivot)
        {
            i++;    // increment index of smaller element
            swap arr[i] and arr[j]
        }
    }
    swap arr[i + 1] and arr[high])
    return (i + 1)
}`


### Merge Sort :

Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides input array in two halves, calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves. The merge() function is used for merging two halves. The merge(arr, l, m, r) is key process that assumes that arr[l..m] and arr[m+1..r] are sorted and merges the two sorted sub-arrays into one. See following C implementation for details.

`MergeSort(arr[], l,  r)
If r > l
     1. Find the middle point to divide the array into two halves:  
             middle m = (l+r)/2
     2. Call mergeSort for first half:   
             Call mergeSort(arr, l, m)
     3. Call mergeSort for second half:
             Call mergeSort(arr, m+1, r)
     4. Merge the two halves sorted in step 2 and 3:
             Call merge(arr, l, m, r)`
	    
class MergeSort 
{ 
    // Merges two subarrays of arr[]. 
    // First subarray is arr[l..m] 
    // Second subarray is arr[m+1..r] 
    void merge(int arr[], int l, int m, int r) 
    { 
        // Find sizes of two subarrays to be merged 
        int n1 = m - l + 1; 
        int n2 = r - m;
